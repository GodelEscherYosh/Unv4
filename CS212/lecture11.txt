Lecture 11 | Data structures

	Announcments:
		Reading: Finishc chapter 3
			-2H should be a very easy project
			-2H, 2G.2 assigned today	
			-2G.2 run it with val to make sure no memory leakage

	Meghanto will be in India
		-No OH tonight


	Slide Repeat: Memory Segments
		-Your program is ivided into 4 segments:
	
		Idea:
			-You have a pointer to a function
			-This pointer can change based on cicumstance
			-when you call the function poitner, it is like calling a known function

	Invoke a function pointer

	EX:

	Function call backs:

		Libraries: Code super usefull too use.
		Python world: Library is just a collection of functions
		When you are writing your code as is, you run into conditions: "what do they want me to do?"
			Call back: If you run into problem, call tih sfunction

	From data structures:
		-List
		-Tuple
		-Dictionary
		-Set
	-> A lot of these are from python
	
	Two key concepts
		It organizes data
		It enables efficient access
